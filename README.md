# Welcome to the Github page for NES

We are a small team of 3 students doing a project for the CISSA CodeBrew 2024

### Project Background
We built a mobile web application called NES Recipes which is used to track your food ingredients and be a handy cookbook at the same time. The application aims to be a convienient way to decide your next meal. This app can (in theory) use the ingredients in your list to recommend recipes you can cook right away!

Our sub-goals for this project are: 
1. Learn about Flask and Material UI
2. Build an app that will encourage us to cook more and prevent food wastage
3. Monetize the app with premium subscriptions and be rich
4. Most importantly, enjoy coding!

### Features added
1. Track ingredients
2. Record recipes
3. Overview of recipes

### How to run the code
1. Run "npm start" in the frontend folder to run the React.js website
2. Run "python main.py" in the backend folder to run the flask server
